Backing-Up Dictionaries      
-----------------------     

*************   If you are upgrading from a previous version of the
* IMPORTANT *   predictive completion package, make sure you first backup
*************   any dictionaries you use by dumping the words and data
they contain to files (unless you want to start from scratch). Use

  M-x predictive-dump-dict-to-file

to make the backups (see Loading and Saving Dictionaries, Emacs
Predictive Completion Manual). It is NOT enough to make a copy of the
dictionary file. Only the plain-text "dumped" format is guaranteed to be
portable across different versions of predictive mode.

Previous versions of the predictive completion package saved dictionaries
in a compiled form that was not portable across different versions of
Emacs. Newer versions now automatically save dictionaries in both
compiled and uncompiled forms. If you are upgrading to a different
version of Emacs, but continuing to use the same version of the
predictive completion package, then it is sufficient to recompile the
dictionaries from the uncompiled files (with extension ".el") using the
`byte-compile-file' command from the new version of Emacs. Alternatively,
you can delete the compiled dictionary files (extension ".elc", but make
sure you do NOT delete the uncompiled files!), and let predictive mode
recompile them automatically when the dictionaries are saved.

However, backing up your dictionaries by dumping them to plain-text
files, as described above, is still a very good idea (just to be on the
safe side!).




Installing
----------

To install the package, extract the files using

  tar -xvzf predictive.tar.gz

This will unpack the files into a new directory called
predictive/. You're strongly encouraged to byte-compile all the Lisp
files and create the required dictionaries by running

  make

in the predictive/ directory (see below for more compilation options). If
necessary, you can specify explicitly where your Emacs resides with

  make EMACS=/path/to/emacs

The recommended installation (see below for alternatives) is to simply copy
the entire predictive/ directory to ~/.emacs.d/predictive/ using

  cp -r /path/to/predictive/ ~/.emacs.d/predictive/

(if it doesn't already exist, you can create the ~/.emacs.d/ directory using
mkdir ~/.emacs.d).

Then add the ~/.emacs.d/predictive/, ~/.emacs.d/predictive/latex/ and
~/.emacs.d/predictive/html/ paths to your load-path, by putting the following
lines in your .emacs file:

  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/predictive/")
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/predictive/latex/")
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/predictive/html/")


If you want the predictive completion minor-mode to be available whenever you
start Emacs, put the following line in your .emacs file:

  (require 'predictive)

Alternatively, you can save memory and only load the lisp libraries when
they're needed (i.e. when you first run the `predictive-mode' command), by
putting the following in your .emacs instead:

  (autoload 'predictive-mode "/path/to/predictive"
            "Turn on Predictive Completion Mode." t)

If you want to enable support for specific major-modes (e.g. LaTeX and html),
you will have to add additional lines to your .emacs file, e.g.:

  (require 'predictive-latex)
  (require 'predictive-html)

Again, there is an autoload alternative:

  (autoload 'predictive-setup-latex "/path/to/predictive-latex")
  (autoload 'predictive-setup-html "/path/to/predictive-html")




Other Installation Options
--------------------------

--- Installing ---

***********   Of course, you're free to ignore the recommended install
* CAREFUL *   location, and instead move all the Lisp files (files with
***********   extensions .el and .elc) from the predictive/ directory to
some other directory in your Emacs load-path (see Lisp Libraries, GNU
Emacs Manual). But note that some of the Lisp files required to support
specific major-modes (e.g. LaTeX and html) are created in subdirectories
of the predictive/ directory (e.g. predictive/latex/ and
predictive/html/), and these files also need to be moved to a directory
in your load-path. You can view the current load-path using `C-h v
load-path' in Emacs.



--- Byte-Compiling ---

For performance reasons, it is important to byte-compile the lisp code, at
least for the core Lisp files. Running

  make

in the predictive/ directory, as described above, does this automatically.

Alternatively, you can do it manually using `byte-compile-file' or one of the
other Emacs byte-compilation commands (see The Compilation Functions, GNU
Emacs Lisp Reference Manual) for all of the Lisp files contained in the
package. Personally, I like to use `dired' when byte-compiling multiple
files from within Emacs. (See Operating on Files, GNU Emacs manual.)



--- Creating the Dictionaries ---

The only pre-prepared dictionary included in the main package is the
English dictionary (so that predictive completion mode works "out of the
box", albeit very slowly if you don't byte-compile!). However, you will
get better results if you roll your own English dictionary and train it
to your own writing style. (See Getting the Most out of Dictionaries,
Predictive Completion Manual.) Other dictionaries (e.g. for LaTeX and
html) are included only as plain-text word lists, from which the
dictionaries can be created. So support for these major modes will not be
available until the dictionaries have been created.

All the dictionaries are created automatically when you run

  make

in the predictive/ directory that was created by extracting the files, as
described above.

The English dictionary can be created separately by running

  make dict-english

The dictionaries for other languages (e.g. LaTeX and html) can be created
separately by running e.g.

  make dict-latex
  make dict-html

in the predictive/ directory. Note that although the make command must be
run in the predictive/ directory, these dictionaries are created in
subdirectories of predictive/ (e.g. predictive/latex/ and
predictive/html/). If you want to create all the dictionaries at once,
without also byte-compiling the predictive mode Lisp files (as "make" on
it's own would do), run

  make dicts

You can, if you prefer, create the dictionaries manually using the
`predictive-create-dict' command from within Emacs. You should give the
dictionary the same file name as the word list file, minus the final
".word-list" extension. (See Creating Dictionaries, Emacs Predictive
Completion Manual.)
